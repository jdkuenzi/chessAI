# ChessAI (Currently Ongoing)

ChessAI is a little project I've made to learn React and use it with a NodeJS backend and an AI developed in Python. 

This is a multiplayer chess game where you can create room and play with friends or you can try to defeat my AI.

## Artificial Intelligence

I'm going to create two AI : 
- Firstly, an AI using the minimax algorithm, this will be much simpler and faster to develop
- Secondly, a Neural Network using Reinforcement Learning to play chess, this will need a lot of infrastructure and time for training
